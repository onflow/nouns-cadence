# nouns-cadence

This is a Cadence implementation of the [Nouns protocol](https://nouns.wtf/), 
a generative avatar art collective on the Ethereum blockchain.

This project is intended for educational purposes and to educate learners
about the Cadence programming language via a recreation of a popular Ethereum
project.

## Quickstart

You can find the contracts in the `contracts/` directory and common transactions
in the `transactions/` directory. 

Tests and packages will be added soon.
